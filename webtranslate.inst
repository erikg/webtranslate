Please note the text to be translated is in the formatting used by C's printf.
The special formatting symbols should be preserved. If a string of 'junk' starts
with a backslash \ or percentile % then it is an escape code or substitution
flag, and should be copied EXACTLY. A copy of the generated PO file will be
emailed to the address you supply, as well as the project maintainer. Please
try the PO file when you receive it and email the maintainer if there are any
issues.
