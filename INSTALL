Installing the Perl version
  
  * Edit webtranslation.conf to suit your needs. Edit the header and footer
    files if you want.
  * Create a user and database in your DBMS (like MySQL or PostGreSQL)
  * Create the tables as described in the tables.* files.
      cat tables.whatever | sqlclient &lt;parms&gt;
  * Copy the cgi files into place
      cp w*.pl w*.[cfh]* /your/cgi-bin/
  * Use 'import.pl' to put your .pot files into the database
  * Give it a test :)
  

Installing the PHP3 version
  
  * Edit webtranslation.inc 
  * Create the user and database for your RDBMS, and initialize the tables. See 
    the perl section for details on how to do that.
  * Copy the php files into your html directory.
       cp w*.php3 w*.[fhi] /your/html_dir/
  * Use import.pl to put your .pot files into the database
  * Knock yourself out
